                I have adopted many skills throughout my degree, internship and personal work. Every piece of technology that I have used along my journey so far is seen above. However, the technologies that I'm most proficient in are below.

                    I've had a lot of experience with python over the years developing a variety of different applications and softwares. Lots of these can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/demstar16" target="_blank">Github</a> or under <a href="./projects.html">projects</a>.
                    I currently mostly use python within frameworks developing web applications.

                    I used a fair amount of java throughout my degree and intend to use it some more for some cool side projects I have coming up. I particularly used Java a lot for my Algorithms course.

                    I have only recently started using react having built a fully functional to do list app called

                    Django is a power house! I really enjoy using it, in fact I just finished creating a web application using it
                    <a href="https://www.cleaningequipmentwa.com.au" target="_blank">here</a>. I also gained experience using it in a large group project for CITS3200 where we created a web application for Ridgefield Farm.

                    I am currently working on learning React as it is a very popular and growing front end framework. So far I am finding it
                    extremely powerful and useful for rendering good UIs quickly and easily.

                    Unreal Engine has a massive learning curve, it can be a very overwhelming software. I've just begun learning it
                    and am already finding it very exciting.
