            <p>
                I have adopted many skills throughout my degree, internship and personal
                work. Every piece of technology that I have used along my journey so far is 
                seen above. However, the technologies that I'm most proficient in are below.
            </p>

                <p>
                    I've had a lot of experience with python over the years
                    developing a variety of different applications and softwares.
                    Lots of these can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/demstar16">Github</a> 
                    or under <a href="./projects.html">projects</a>. I currently mostly use python
                    within frameworks developing web applications.

                <p>
                    I used a lot of C  throughout my university course and am currently using it for my
                    Harvard CS50x course that I'm currently taking. A couple of my 
                    <a href="./projects.html">projects</a> are predominantly in C.

                    I have only recently started using typescript, but having a good foundational knowledge of 
                    javascript help really flatten the learning curve for me and now I prefer and love TypeScript :)

                    Django is a power house! I really enjoy using it, in fact I just finished creating a web application using it 
                    <a href="cewa.d-sons.com">here</a>. I also gained experience using it in a large group project for CITS3200 
                    where we created a web application for Ridgefield Farm.

                <img src="../images/flask.png">
                <p>
                    I enjoy using flask for small applications as Django can be overkill. It is relatively easy to use in comparison to Django.
                    I gained experience using this in the CITS3403 Web Dev course and am currently using it to create a web game.

                    I am currently working on learning React as it is a very popular and growing front end framework. So far I am finding it
                    extremely powerful and useful for rendering good UIs quickly and easily.

                    I am currently learning C++ due to its power and common use in the world of game development which is a big interest of mine.

                    Unity has a massive learning curve, it can be a very overwhelming software at times. I'm slowly getting used to it. I am currently 
                    working on a 3D 3rd person shooter with a friend which is very fun.
